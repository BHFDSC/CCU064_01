## Project description
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common complication arising in pregnancy, associated with adverse obstetric outcomes, and also strongly linked to socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic background. We aimed to identify high-risk groups for both GDM diagnosis and subsequent negative outcomes. We developed a cross-sectional observational birth cohort using routinely collected data from NHS England hospitals, capturing over 2.75 million births between 2018 and 2022.

This project aims to estimate the rise of GDM in England during recent years, assess the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes for women diagnosed with GDM, identify sectors of the population (based on ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation) most at risk of developing GDM and suffering these adverse obstetric outcomes, and investigate how the emergency changes to GDM diagnosis and screening established during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the maternity population.
